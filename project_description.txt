Project Description Document: Optimal Liquidation Listings Finder
Overview
The Optimal Liquidation Listings Finder is a software tool designed to help users search and find optimal liquidation listings. The tool gathers liquidation listings from various sources (like liquidation.com), extracts item details, and cross-references these items with eBay listings to analyze selling history data. The primary goal is to provide users with detailed insights into the value of liquidation lots and individual items.

Project Goals
Data Aggregation: Collect liquidation listings from multiple websites.
Cross-Referencing: Match items from liquidation listings with eBay listings.
Value Analysis: Use eBay's selling history to evaluate the potential value of liquidation lots and items.
API Development: Create a robust backend API to handle data fetching, processing, and storage.
Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask/FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL/MongoDB
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or similar
External APIs: eBay API for item data
API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI
Key Features
Liquidation Listings Fetching: Scrape listings from sites like liquidation.com.
Item Data Extraction: Extract item details such as name, quantity, category, and description.
eBay Cross-Referencing: Query eBay API for historical selling data on listed items.
Value Assessment: Analyze and aggregate eBay data to determine item and lot values.
API Endpoints:
Fetch listings
Get item details
Retrieve eBay selling history
Analyze and assess values
